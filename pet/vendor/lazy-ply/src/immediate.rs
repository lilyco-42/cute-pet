//! Frame-scoped current [`Ui`] context — the bridge that lets components render
//! without threading `ui` through every call, immediate-mode style.
//!
//! [`with_ui`] installs the current frame's [`Ui`] for the duration of a
//! closure; components then fetch it with [`current_ui`] and render directly:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut ui = ply.begin();
//!
//! ui.element()
//!   .width(grow!())
//!   .height(grow!())
//!   .layout(|l| l.align(CenterX, CenterY))
//!   .children(|ui| {
//!     with_ui(ui, || {
//!       if 按钮("点我") {
//!         println!("Hi");
//!       }
//!     });
//!   });
//!
//! ui.show(|_| {}).await;
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! [`current_ui`] hands out a mutable reference to the [`Ui`] created by
//! `Ply::begin()` with its borrow lifetime boosted to `'static`. This is sound
//! only because every component uses it transiently, *within* the [`with_ui`]
//! scope that installed it, and components never hold the returned reference
//! across other components or frames. Never store a [`current_ui`] reference
//! past the surrounding [`with_ui`] scope.
